v imp function

Allows you to control a remote machine/server using a terminal/CLI

what do you have?
EC2 Machine Linux 

What does machine have?
Public IP

What do we want to do?
We want to access it.

What else do we have?
Security Group with port 22 for SSH on it

What will happen
Our computer accesses over web through  port 22 and access the machine

CLI will be just as if we are inside that machine



1) Go to instance console: EC2 Dashoard -> Instances -> My First Instance
//what does instance has? 
Public DNS and Public IP

How do we connect from your computer over the web to this instance?
Public DNS and Public IP
//check IPv4 Public IP : Copy it

2) In same instance page: Check security group:click view inbound rules, what does it say? Port 22 is open on the protocol TCP
What is source 0.0.0.0/ : what does this mean ? anyone

3) Open a TERMINAL 
** type: ss ec2 -user@35.100.100.144 //other part is the IP copied
//what is ec2-user: : Linux user in amazon linux machine 
@ defines IP

** Yes wanna continue
PERMISSION DENIED

//cannot SSH into machine why?
what do we know
we launched a machine
we it has a public IP and port 22 is open
We dont want anyone to enter though

How to control?
Thats why key file is needed
We need that key to get into our machine

Place that key in directory : aws-course //for ex

in TERMINAL
* *ls EC2Tutorial.pem
~/aws-courses
*ssh - i EC2Tutorial.pem  ec2-user@35.100.100.144 
-> Press enter
//Another Warning : Unprotected private key file
why this error? -> unprotected private keyfile
when we first download the key file: permission is: 0644 : too Open : private key can leak
Fix this?
**chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem //reference the key name
** ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.100.100.144
//YOU ARE IN THE MACHINE: AMAZON LINUX 2 AMI

* whoami
 //displays ec2user

example of things you can do?
*ping google.com
what will this give?
Google.com will talk to us
ping command takes input : IP address/ URL and sends Data packet to the specified address with message "PING"

//NOW BASICALLY WE ARE INTO THE EC2 SERVER
What can we do now?
We can run commands from here
