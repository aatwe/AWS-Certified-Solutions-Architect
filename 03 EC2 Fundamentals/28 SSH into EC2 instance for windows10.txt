We use SSH instead of Putty to log on to EC2 instance


POwer shell
~ssh
//you get many options for usage of ssh
//what does this mean?You have access to ssh
//Can also do via CLI
//if you see ssh command not found : means you dont have ssh isntalled, youll have to use putty to connect to EC2 instance


//If you have ssh command 
//i stands for : identity file i.e : EC2 tutorial.pem file //browse and copy location
//ec2-user : is the user that 
//@ means public IP : Copy your Public IPv4 : note ip changes when you restart the machine
~ssh - i C:\Users\Stephane\Downloads\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user @35.180.242.162
-> press enter -> verify the authenticity : yes
->ERROR
WARNING UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE
//we want pem file to be protected correctly and have correct permissions
we did chmod earlier but for windows chmod does not exist

-> Go To PEM file -> properties -> security -> Advanced
Check the owner of the key //change option
search for stephane : and check name
This owner has to be you ->Press Ok

-> remove all other user possible //because it has inheritance -
-> Apply oK

All properties of security file: you have full control

try
~ssh - i C:\Users\Stephane\Downloads\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user @35.180.242.162

LOGGED ON TO AMAZON LINUX 2 EC2 Instance
because you have right permissions for security
Yes/No question was not prompted because we already told windows to trust this EC2 instance and IP


Try the same on CLI 
IT will work
