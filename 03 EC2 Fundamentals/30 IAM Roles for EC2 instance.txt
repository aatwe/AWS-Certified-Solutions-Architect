1) Connect to my EC2 instance : SSH/Instance connect etc

2) Web browser CLI

3) ping google.com
/Check

4) clear

5)~ aws --version
///Amazon Linux 2 AMI comes with AWS CLI
hence installed

6)~aws iam list-users
//response: unable to look at credentials by using aws configure

//COuld do -> ~aws configure & specify access key id, access key, region name and output format
BUT BAD IDEA
//if we enter our personal details here on this instance, anyone in our account can connect to our instance using 
EC2 instance connect and retrieve these values
NOT WHAT WE  WANT
RULE OF THUMB: Never ever enter your id and access keys into an EC2 instancce

Instead use IAM roles

7) Search IAM -> Roles ->DemoRolesforEC2-> permissions: IAMReadOnlyAccess
Attach this role onto our EC2 instance : to provide it with credentials

8) EC2 -> instances -> Credentials
Security -> No IAM Role currently

Instance -> Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM Role

DemoRoleforEC2 -> Save

Check back into EC2 -> Instances -> Security: Can See DemoRoleforEC2

9)~aws iam list-users
Now will get response
with user stephane


//WHAT WE DID? Just attached an IAM Role  and run this command
detach the permission from role and try: you will get access denied error again

CORRECT WAY TO PROVIDE AWS Credential to EC2 INSTANCES IS VIA IAM ROLES
