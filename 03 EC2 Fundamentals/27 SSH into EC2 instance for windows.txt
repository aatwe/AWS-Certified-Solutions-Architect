->Putty -> MyEC2 instance -> Load -> 
currently on sessions -> go to Connections -> SSH -> Auth -> Browse pvt key file for authentication and save 
//Dont click open yet
go back to sessions -> Save the session for My EC2 instance
//why? this way myec2 instance  will have the ppk file 
-> CLICK OPEN
//YOU ARE INSIDE THE MACHINE
//test it out on CLI
*whoami -> o/p : ec2 user

* ping google.com ->google .com will respond and we will get information from it
*exit
