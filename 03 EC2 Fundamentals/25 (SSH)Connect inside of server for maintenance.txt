SSH
Based on OS: we have different ways of SSH

		SSH		Putty		EC2 Instance Connect

Mac    		Can be used			Can be used	

Linux		Can be used			Can be used

Windows<10			Can be used	Can be used

Windows >10	Can be used	Can be used	Can be used

Putty: Does exact same thing as SSH
What?
Allows to connect to SSH protocol to connect to EC2 instances

Personally in future: we will use EC2 instance connect //CLI not needed
