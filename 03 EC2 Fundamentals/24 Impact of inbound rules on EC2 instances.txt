EC2 Dashboard -> EC2 instance : Public IPv4 address : open
//can see the hello world

Now we edit the inbound rules
How?
Security groups -> Inbound Rules -> Edit inbound rules

emove both http
and save


Reload the webpage : loading is happening : means? trying to access EC2 instance but no response back to it

coz we have removed http rules , we are forbidding traffic to get into our ec2 instance

After 30 seconds waiting for response: web browser times out 

When you get a time out(ERR_TIMED_OUT): it is generally a securtiy group issue
Endless loading circle: security group settings always check


We add back the inbound rules with source anywhere : we get back the hello world
The firewall is allowing the traffic to go in now
