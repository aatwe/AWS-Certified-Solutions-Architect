Connect to an instance Option

EC2 Instance COnnect
1) Specify the user name   : ec2-user
//note EC2 instance connect does not work with every type of AMIs in AWS
			works for amazon linux 2/Ubuntu
-> Connect
2) This will connect automatically to EC2 instance
What is differnce? Not using SSH key like before.Still relying on it though
It is uploading temporary SSH key on EC2 instance for you

Proof?
Try:
EC2 instance -> Security -> Security Groups -> Remove SSH rule -> Save

Try connecting via EC2 isntance connect
BLACKSCREEN AND TIMEOUT

you need port 22 /ssh open

Add Rule again: It will work again
