A) Create FILE SYStem


1) Aws -> services
	Search -> EFS 
	  -> Create File System

2) Name:
   Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

   Availability and durability : Standard

   -> Customize -> File System settings


3) File System settings:
	a) Name

	b) Availability and durablity
		Regional:	//across multiple AZ
				//production setup

		One Zone: 	redundantly stored within single AZ
			what con? if AZ down, file system down


	c) Automated Backup
		Enable / Disable

	d) Lifecycle managment: automatically achieves right price / blend for application
			moves files bw standard and standard infrequent access storage classes

		d.1) if objects not used often -> trainsition them to different access tier (Standard Infrequent Access Storage class)

		d.2) if file not accessed for 30 days -> transition to IA
	
		//autobackups	
		d.3) transition out of IA : 
					on first access
					or never

		//Performance mode
		d.4) 
			d.4.1) General Purpose : latnency sensitive use cases
					ex webserivng, content mgmt
					ex wordpress + need  storage -> General Purpose
		     d.4.2) Max I/O : high throughput and IOPS
					ex big data use case,
						con? high latency


		//Throughput mode

		d.5) 
			d.5.1) Bursting: 		//throughput scales with file system size ( if big file system -> more throughput)
			d.5.2) Provisioned		//fixed throughput
									//value between 1 to 1024 MBps
								//helpful when tiny file system	
								//what con? not useful if needs lots of throughputs

		d.6) Encryption of data at rest //tick
	

		--> Next


4) Network Access:
		a) Choose default VPC

		b) mount targets
			what is mount target?provides endpoint.
							what use of this endpoint? can mount Amazon EFS filesystem at it
									why mount? see later we use in cmd as endpoint
										mount specs? 1 mount target per AZ


		ex
		AZ1 --> Subnet ID ---> IP address --> Security groups
														
		AZ2 --> Subnet ID --> IP Address --> Security groups

		AZ2 --> Subnet ID --> IP Address --> Security groups

		
		we have to create specific EC2 for file system
		EC2 console
			Security groups
				Create security group
					efs-demo		//cant start with sg
					
					Description: EFS Demo SG


				no inbound rules


					==> Create security groups
					//EFS Demo created successfully


		//Use in mount target -> refresh
		AZ1 --> Subnet ID ---> IP address --> Security groups
									  choose your security groups
														
		AZ2 --> Subnet ID --> IP Address --> Security groups

		AZ2 --> Subnet ID --> IP Address --> Security groups



	=> Next


5) File System Policy - optional		///advanced


6) Review and create	//all file system settings
	File system policy
	
	-> Create

//File System is creating
//File System is created


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazon EFS - File Systems - fs-03...

	Metered Size: 6 KB		//this is the only size used rn	//paying only for the storage we use


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

B) 	How to mount this created EFS on EC3 instance

  B.1) launch instance a

	1) Create EC2 Instances -> instances -> launch instances

	2) Launch an instance
		amazon linux
		instance type: t2.micro

		disable key pair
		
	3) Network settings
			//new security group will be created
	
	//Allow SSH access from anywhere

	4) Configure Storage
		//note: have to configure this ec2 instance storage into Amazon EFS.
		8GB		
			0x File systems -> edit
					//cannot add file system before selecting subnet

					4.1) Network settings -> Edit -> choose Subnet : eu-west-1a	

			ox File Systems -> Edit		//see below file systems
					a) EFS
					b) FSx		


			=> Add shared File System
				//linked to our EFS  how linked? has a mount point : /mnt/efs/fs1					//Why Mmount point? links Ec2 instance to file system

		automatically create and attach security groups

		automatically mounts shared file system , how? attaches required user data scripts (earlier had to manually run script on instance /  create our own user script)
																		//now done by EC2 console //helpful



	5) no. of instance:1 

	-> Launch Instance
		-> view all instances


  B.2) launch instance b


	1) no key pair
	2) eu-west-1b
	3) select existing security group of launch-wizard2

	Configure storage 
	  0x - File systems -> Edit
			a) EFS
					b) FSx		


			=> Add shared File System
				//linked to our EFS  how linked? has a mount point : /mnt/efs/fs1					//Why Mmount point? links Ec2 instance to file system

		automatically create and attach security groups

		automatically mounts shared file system , how? attaches required user data scripts (earlier had to manually run script on instance /  create our own user script)
																		//now done by EC2 console //helpful



	=> Launch instance
			


 B.3)  //see both instances running

	1) EFS console ->network

			each AZ : has multiple security groups
			//these securit groups were auto created by EC2 console for us + attached to EFS file system

	2) Services -> Network & Security -> Security groups
		//select your security group
			
			Inbound Rules

					allows NFS on port 2049
					-> Edit
						source security group: sg-0521b4deede655ee4
	
							what special about this security group? attached to EC2 instance B
						
							Conclusion: EFS Ec2 instance B can access file system


B.4) COnnect one instance
		Instance A -> Connect 
			EC2 instance connect
				Connect

		Instance B -> Connect 
			EC2 instance connect
				Connect



B.5) Verify that shared filessystem

	b.5.1) in  instance A (new tab):
			/mnt/efs/fs1		//File system exists								//Why mount point? /mnt/efs/fs1	Endpoint that we use in/for both instances to connect to EFS
			sudo su
			# echo "hello world" > /mnt/efs/fs1/hello.txt
			cat /mnt/efs/fs1/hello.txt

		>hello world			//File got created into -> EFS File system from instance A  
									where is this instance? eu-west-1a

	b.5.2) in  instance B (new tab):
			/mnt/efs/fs1		//File system exists
			ls /mnt/efs/fs1
		
		>hello.txt 
			cat /mnt/efs/fs1/hello.txt	
		hello world



CONCLUSION: EFS File system mounted as a network drive on both EC2 instance
		both instances in different AZs
		both instances share same EFS
					
	
			
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In end:

a) termiante both EC2 instances
select -> instance  state -> terminate instance

b) EFS file system -> 
Amazon EFS -> File systems ->
Delete		//confirm EFS id


c) security groups
	delete extra security groups
