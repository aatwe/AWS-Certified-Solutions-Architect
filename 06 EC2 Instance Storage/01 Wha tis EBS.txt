Problem: how instance can persist data even after termination?


EBS volume : network drive  //block level storage
		//like USB Sticks 

	
	
How to use? attach to instances while they run

solution: instance can presist data even after they are terminated

For CCP level: can attach to 	one isntance at a time

For associate(sol/archi/dev/sysops) : multi attach feature for some ebs

bound to a AZ



How much storage? 30GB General purpose(SSD) / Magnetic


What feature? can deattach and attach v quickly for failover


Where locked? special AZ	 
	us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
	//can move across AZ after snapshotting

Need to have provisioned capacity
			(G.Bs and IOPS)
		//billed for what? that provisioned capacity
		//can increase capacity over time


Q) Can we have 2 EBs volume attached to 1 instance

Q) Can we have unattached EBS vol? yes

Q) What for other AZ? create new

Ex


	AZ1
	  EC2-instance#1		EC2-instance#2
		EBS Vol#1(10GB)		EBS Vol#2(10GB)	EBS Vol#3(10GB)





Q) WHat is delete ont ermination attribute?
	encountered while creating EBS vol
		-> while creating EC2 instance
			delete on termination button
		What it does??
			//ticked for EBS root vol
			//unticked for new EBS

		What it does?
			controls EBS behaviour, when a EC2 instance is terminated

		if ticket -> root also deleted with instance when instance deleted
		//any other //not ticked // any other attached is not delted


	What use case? preserve root volume when instance deleted
