a)  EBS Volumes
		a.1) can attach to only 1 instance at a time
		a.2) EBS locked into specific AZ
	
				AZ1			AZ2
				 EC2			 EC2
				   EBS					//1 EBS attached to 1 AZ at a time


		ex
			gp2 -- IO increase as disk size increase


			io1 -- increase IO independently from vol size
				//usecaserunning critical database



		Q) How to  migrate EBS across different AZ?
				take snapshots
				restore snapshot into another AZ
				new EBS volume created in respective AZ


				//Note : EBS backups use IO
						dont run them while application is handling a lot of traffic
						//backup only when instance not aactively 	using EBS volumes
							//else performance issues

	
		Q) what if EC2 instance terminated? root EBS termiantes by default
				how to disable?	//check EBS notes
		
		a.3)  provision in advance for size we know for EBS drive
				what we pay for? provisioned capacity // not actual use capacity

		a.4) basically EBS is for network volume, can mount on only 1 instance
				EBS is locked to an AZ

b) EFS Volumes

		a.1) Elastic files system
		a.2) can be mounted to many instances across AZs
				
				AZ1		AZ2
				 Linux	 Linux
				  EC2#1	   EC2#2
				
				  mounttrgt1  mount trgt2
					 \      /
					   EFS

		a.3) how to link EC21 instances to EFS drive? mount targets


		a.4) EFS use case? share website files
						wordpress
		a.5) Which instances compatible for EFS? Linux Instances (POSIX)
					//does not work for windows


		a.6) Is EFS more expensive  than EBS? yes   EFS Price = 3x EBS

				how to do cost saving?
					Use EFS Infrequent access as a storage tier  	//how to use? lifecycle policy

		a.7) billing only for pay per view	(only what storage u use, u get billed for
	
		a.8) basically: EFS is for network file system that we can mount across multiple isntances



c) Instance Store:
		c.1) get maximum amount of IO onto an EC2 instance
		c.2) ephemeral drive
