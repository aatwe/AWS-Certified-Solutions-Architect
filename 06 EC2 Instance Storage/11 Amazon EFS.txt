I) Elastic File System

1) What is Amazon EFS? 

	a) managed network file system
	
	b) feature? can be mounted on many EC2

	c) does it work with EC2 isntance in multiple AZ? Yes
	
	d) cost? high : 3x cost of a gp2 EBS volume

	e) do we have to provision capacity? no
			pay per view
			//pay before using


2) ex

		AZ1				AZ2				AZ3
		 EC2 instance		  EC2 instances		 EC2 instance
				\			|			/

						Security grp
						EFS File System

ConclusioN: all isntance can connect at same network file system
through EFS
		


3) What use case of EFS?
	content management : webseerving , data sharing, wordpress

4) What protocol EFS use? NFS protocol

5) What security group does?
	controls access to EFS


6) What AMI EFS works with?
	only Linux Based AMI  (Not windows)

7) How to enable encryption with EFS drive?
	Encryption at rest -> KMS 

8) What file system used by EFS?
	POSIX file system(~Linux)
		what API this file system uses?
			standard file API

8)Capacity restriction for this file system?
	scales auto -> pay per use //no capacity planning
		//for each gb data in EFS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II) EFS performance and Storage classes
	a) What scale? 1000s concurrent NFS clients

				 10 GB ps of throughput

				 can grow to petabyte scale NFS (1000 TB)


	b) What performance mode?
			
			a) General Purpose :  (default) : latency sensitive use cases (web servers + CMS etc)

			b) Maximize IO: high latency , high throughput , highly parallel
					//Big data, media processing need for file system

			c) Throughput mode:
					c.1) Bursting mode (1Tb stroage size gives => 50 MBps data transfer speed + 100 mbps for EFS file system
					c.2) Provisioned :  no matter what storage size => for ex can have 1GBps on 1 TB storage for EFS file system


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III) EFS Storage Classes

	a) Setup storage tiers 

		What is storage tier? lifecycle management feature	(Move files to different tier)

		a.1) standard tier : For frequently accessed file

		a.2) infrequent access tier (EFS-IA) : has cost to retrieve files
										//storage cost: low	
										//how to enable EFS-IA? lifecycle policy

	

	Ex
		frequently used files : EFS Standard

		a) 	Amazon EFS System	
				EFS Standard
					frequently used files	

		b) what if we dont access 1 file for >60 days

		c) Lifecycle policy -> file moved to EFS-IA -> in different tier

		d) What about availability and durability
				multi AZ EFS	//great for production use cases
						//implies: if AZ goes down -> doesnt affect EFS	

				//What if we want 1 zone EFS file system? EFS One Zone-IA
				//great for development

		e) what about backups for EFS? enabled by default
								is it compatible with infrequent access tier? yes compatible with infrequent access storage tier 	 (EFS- One Zone IA)

								//more aggressive discount	90% 



IV) When to Use EFS?
	What option to set on EFS network file system? 	//for validating and comply with requirements
