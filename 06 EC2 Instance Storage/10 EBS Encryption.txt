How to encrypt EBS volume?

1) what is encrypted using EBS encryption?
	a) all data at rest
	b) all data in flight bw instance and vol
	c) all snapshots
	d) all volumes created from snapshot
	//all done behind the scene //transperent to us


2) minimal impact on latency
	does encryption affect latency? no

3) 	fact: leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
		what is KMS? AWS KMS : lets us create,manage,control
			cryyptographic keys across applications + 100 AWS services

Q) what if we copy unencrypted snapshot --> encryption enabled	//how encryption is enabled
Q) What if we snapshot an encrypted volume --> snapshot also encrypted

//How to encrypt a unencrypted EBS volume?
a) create EBS snapshot of unencrypted vol

b) Use Copy function : Encrypt the unencrypted snapshot

c) create new EBS volume from the encrypted snapshot

d) volume gets encrypted

e) attach encrypted volume to original instance

--------------Hands On------------------------------

a) Elastic Block Store -> Volumes -> Create Volume

b) vol type: gp2
   size    : 1GB
   az 	: eu-west-1a
   encryption : encrypt this vol : unchecked
 

-> Create volume 
//check volume -> details:

	Encryption not encrypted

c) 
//How to encrypt this volume? Create snapshot from volume
	 Select volume -> Actions -> Create snapshot 
	
	Check snapshot details : Encryption not encrypted

d) select snapshot -> Actions- > Copy snapshot

	Select : Encrypt this snapshot

	KMS key: aws/ebs

	-> Copy Snapshot


e) check copied snapshot details:
	
	select action -> Create volume from snapshot

	1GB
	//encryption: auto enabled for this volume

	-> Create volume

f) CHeck volume
	Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume

		//newly created volume
		//Details:
		
		Volume state: available 
		Encryption: Encrypted




Note: Shortcut:
1) select unencrypted snapshot -> encryption: not encrypted
		-> Actions -> Create volume from snapshot -> encrypt this volume 
		
		-> Select EBS key

		-> Create volume

------------------------------------------
Actions -> Delete snapshot
//Delete snapshot after use
Actions -> Delete volume
//after use
