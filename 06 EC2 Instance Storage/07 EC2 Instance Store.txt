1) What we know? how to attach network drive to EC2 instances


2) what problem? network drive has limited performances

	solution for high performance? Hardware disk


3) what we know about EC2 instance ? Virtual machine, attached to some real hardware server
		These hardware servers may have actual disk space

Solution: EC2 instance store
	//what is it? the name of hardware to which hard drive is attached to physical server

 //what features?
	a) better IO performance
	b) good throughput
			how fast can read/write data  (MB/s)

  What caveat?
	a) if stop EC2 instance with instance store? 
		instance  store -> storage lost

		//Called as Ephemeral storage (not good long term)


  What use case?
	a) Buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
		//great place

		what good for long term? EBS

	b) Backup and replicate our responsibility
			hardware may fail

	

Ex

Instance size of			100% Random read IOS		Write IOPS

i3.large				100,125				35000
i3.xlarge				206,250				70,000
i3.2xlarge
...
i3.16xlarge			3.3 million			1.4 million

EBS vol : reaches 32k IOPS
these reach millions

local EC2 Instance store : high performance
