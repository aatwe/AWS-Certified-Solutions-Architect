//Check EBS Volume attached to instance

a) Instance -> Storage -> root device name
				 -> block device	: 8GB Volume attached
					volume: in use , attached


//How to access volume?
a) Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume
	8Gb  EBS visible

//How to create second volume?
b)  Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume
	Create volume

c) Volume type: gp2,gp3,...

d) Size: 2 GB

e) Availability zone: //same as EC2 instance
		(find from Services -> Instances ->

f) -> Create volume

------Volume created -------------

a) Select volume -> Action-> attach volume

b) instance
   Device name
	Attach volume

c) Now volume attached
-------Instance has 2 volumes attached ------------

//how to check
Instances -> Storage -> EC2 console -> how many block devices
	8GB
	2GB


//How to use block device? out of scope
	//google attach and mount on EBS Volume

-------------------------------------------------
//Try creating volume for different AZ

a) Volume -> Create volume ->
	
b) 2GB

c) AZ = eu-west-1a	//different AZ than EC2

Create volume

d) Check volumes
Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume

2GB
8GB
2GB //select -> actions -> Attach volume -> //cannot find EC2 instance

//Cannot attach to EC2 instance 


//Proof: EBS volume are bound by AZ


   //Select -> actions -> delte volume


//Why cool? can request volumes / delete volumes in matter of seconds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What if we terminate our instance?
a) Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume
						delete on termination
	8GB		---> 			Yes
	2GB		--> 			NO

//When and how is this yes?
b) Launch instance => Configure storeage -> advanced -> EBS  volumes -> check delte on termination indicator for you EBS device



//Test
c)  Instances
Select your instance -> Terminate Instance
//check instances -> removed


d) Services -> Elastic Block Store -> Volume
	Refresh
	terminates after a while	 

	2GB
