1) What happens to data on instance on stop and start?

	STOP: Data on disk(EBS) is intact for next START

	TERMINATE : volume setup to be destroyed --> termianted
			 volume not setup to be des   --> kept




	START: OS Boots -> EC2 User Data script is run
		 OS Boot complete
		 Appplication starts, caches warm 


	
Why Hibernet? 
	if Hibernet --> in-memory state is preserved
		which causes:
			instance boot fast,OS frozen


	What happens underhood in hibernet?
		ram state data -> written in root data on disk(EBS) volume
			//prerequisites:
				root EBS should be encrypted
				root EBS should have space to contain RAM


-------------------------------------------------------------


a) Scenario: EC2 instance running, data in RAM

b) start hibernation process

c) instance --> stopping state
   ram dump --> EBS volume
   
d) EC2 instance shuts down
	//RAM disappears

e) EBS volume still contains? RAM dump

f) EC2 instance starts
   ram loaded from  EBS volume  --> to EC2 instance memory 

g) All works as if EC2 network didnt stop



Why Hibernate?
	a) Long running processes	//never stop them

	b) Save RAM state

	c) reboot/boot fast	//want services to keep running even if hibernete instance



EC2 Hibernate supported by?
Instance families: C3,C4,C5,I3,M3,M4,R3,R4,T2,T3...
RAM Size : <150 GB
Instance Size: not supported for bare metal instances
OS Supported: Amazon Linux2, Linux AMI,ubuntu, CentOS, Windows

Root volume : hsould be EBS,encrypted, not instance store, large enough to contain RAM (dump)

Available forinstances ? On Demand, Reserved, Spot isntances

what hibernation period? <=60 days
