Services -> Instances -> Running Instance --> Details:


	Public IPv4 address


a) ssh into our instance using //public IP
	ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@3.129.218.15
							-----------
							public ip

	//logged in

> ec2-user@ip-172-31-11-234		//can see your private ip
----------    ------------		
instance  	    private ip
hostname

b) Ctrl+C -> logout

c) ssh into our instance using Private IPv4	 3.129.218.15
			//can find it in details now since we connected once


ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@3.129.218.15
						-----------
						  private IP

//Does not work

why cant connect to ec2 using private ip 3.129.218.15 ?
	a) it belongs to our private network
	b) we are not connected to private network of aws
	
	c) where we connected then? Internet

	d) Solution: use public IP to access AWS from public network

How public iP changes after starting and stopping instance?	 

Check instance behaviour
a) Stop instance --> copy public IP

b) Start instance 	//this is not rebooting instance

c) check public ip in details
	//public ip changed
	try ssh with new ip -> works

How to not let public ip change after starting and stopping?
elastic ip

a) Elastic IP
	Details -> Elastic IP Address : null


//How to allocate elastic ip to our private ip
b) Services -> Network & Security -> Elastic IPs
	
	b.1) Amazon's pool of IPv4 Addresses
			
	b.2) Allocate

		//New IPv4 we own, created  /18.216.64.85
		//if we dont attach elastic IP immediately -> charged

	b.3) Actions -> Associate Elastic IP Address
		b.3.1) attach to what? Instance / Network interface
				
		b.3.2) select running instance
			
		b.3.3) Select what Private IP to associate Elastic IP

	b.4) Refresh EC2 instance
			//see our public ip 	18.216.64.85


	b.5) Try to ssh again with elastic public ip
		ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@18.216.64.85

	b.6) what if we stop isntance?
			//still public elastic ipv4 visible

	b.7) start again
			//still public elastic ipv4 visible


//How to disassociate elastic ip?
a)  Services -> Network & Security -> Elastic IPs
	
b) Actions -> Disassociate Elastic IP Address
		

c) Actions -> Release elastic IP
//test again -> new ip every time we start and stop


d) Terminate instance in end
