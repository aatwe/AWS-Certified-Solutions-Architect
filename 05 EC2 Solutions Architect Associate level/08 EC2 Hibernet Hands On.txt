//How to launch an instance

a) Amazon Linux Machine: Amazon Linux 2 AMI

b) instance type: t2.micro

c) Key Pair: EC2 Tutorial 

d) network Settings edit:
	d.1) Select existing Security group
			launch-wizard-1

e) Advanced details:
	Stop hibernate Behaviour -> Enable
		//what it does? enable hibernation on EC2 instance
	//if enable hibernation 
		//make sure  root volume has enough storage to fit RAM
		of EC2 instance
		++ Root EBS volume -> should be encrypted
	
//Setup EBS volume
f) Storage -> Advanced -> Choose EBS volume -> Yes  encrypt
	-> Choose default AWS key to encrypt
	//EBS Volume is set up


g) Storage:
	Size: 8GB volume
	//how to know if enough?
		check instance type: t2.micro
			//1 GB ram

	//1 GB ram fits on disk  -> good enough


----> Launch Instances

---------Instance is created  ++ Hibernation enabled------------------- 
						//hibernation also enabled

---------Testing hibernation--------------------------

a) connect ot instance
	Services -> Instances -> Connect -> EC2 Instance Connect -> Connect

	
//Connected to instance in new tab


//How to check how long instance running since restart? command uptime

uptime
	//0minutes
	//wait

uptime
	//1 minute	


b) Disconnect instance(close the instance window)

Instance state --> Hibernate instance

//What this will do?
//makes sure all data in RAM --> is stored on EBS volume


//wait

c) start instance again 
	//how to check if it was hibernated? uptime should not be 0


d)  connect ot instance
