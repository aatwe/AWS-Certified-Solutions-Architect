Networking:  
	IPV4
		1.160.10.240	//4 no. + 3 dot

	IPV6
		3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf	//long string
	

What we use? IPv4
	how many addresses? 3.7 billion (2^32)
	each no. 0 - 255
	[0-255][0-255][0-255][0-255][0-255]	

Why IPv6? solves problems for IOT



How related to webserver?
Public Network : Its own IP Address
	How they talk to each other?
a)    webserver/EC2 instance = public = IP :79.216.59.75

b)    Server   		    = public = IP :211.139.37.43


Private Network(Company A): Its own IP private IP : 192.168.0.1/22
	How they talk to each other? pvt IP

c) 	Private Computer1  

	//All computers can talk using pvt IPs

d) 	Private Computer2      

Q1) how private network (Company A) gets access to public network servers(EC2 etc)?

Public Internet Gateway (149.140.72.10)


Q2) How private network (company B) gets access to public network?

Public Internet Gateway (192.168.0.1/22)



Conclusion:
1) computer has private IP
2) Router has public IP
connected to internet via router

public IP(My router): can find machine on internet
				every machine : unique individual ip
				can geo locate	

private IP		    :can find machine only in pvt nw
				unique ip in pvt nw
				2 nw can have same ip

	How pvt nw machine connect to www? internet gateway



Elastic IP: if start and stop ec2 instance
			public ip changes
	Solution: Elastic IP
	

What use? if a software fails(instance on / off) on an instance --> quickly move it to another



how many elastic ip allowed in aws account? 5

should u use elastic ip? NO, avoid
	why? shows poor architectural decision
		
what to use instead of elastic ip?
	random public IP and register a DNS OR Load balancer
								//more controllable + scalable
				
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) what ec2 machine has by default? pvt IP  //why pvt? internal AWS network
		 & public IP				//for www

b) do SSH into machines
	//cant use pvt ip afterwards ,why? not on same network		
			how to use pvt ip still if want to? Use VPN
 
	//can only use public IP 	//no VPN

c) if start and stop machine
		//public ip changes
