//Launch 2 instances

1) INstances -> Launch Instances

	Key pair -> EC2 Tutorial

	

2) Network settings -> edit -> Existing security groups
						launch-wizard-1


3) Summary
	Number of instances : 2


	-> Launch Instances


4) Check instances
		//select 1 -> Networking -> Network interfaces

		//can see each instance have network interface (ENI) -- ENI ID -- public IPv4 -- Pvt IPv4 -- IPv4 DNS

		//ConclusioN: each interaface has : public IPv4 -- Pvt IPv4 -- IPv4 DNS
		


5) Network & Security --> Network Interfaces

//How to create secondary IPv4

a) 
		ENI 1		//instance id	//in use
			
		ENI 2		//isntance id	//in use


b) Create a new network interface
	Description : DemoENI
	Subnet	 : //choose for specific AZ
	Pvt IPv4 	 : auto assign / Custom


c) Security Groups	
	a) select your security group to attach to ENi


//Create network Interface


a)  Check network interface

 		ENI 1		//instance id	//in use
			
		ENI 2		//isntance id	//in use

		DemoENI	//isntance id	//Available

b)   -> Attach -> Choose Instance -> Attach		//How to attach created secondary IPv4 

c)  	//Check instances instance #1-> NEtwork Interfaces

	a) Default 	-  public IPv4 - Private IPv4 - PPrivate IPv4 DNS
	
	b) DemoENI		-  			 Private IPv4(secondary) - PPrivate IPv4 DNS		//We created secondary ENI



///What can we do with this secondary ENI? move from one to another

a) 	//Scenario: 2 instances running in same application, how to access them using pvt IPv4? Move ENI


b) Networkinterface
	Select your ENI

c) Actions -> Detach  //force detach if needed

d) Actions -> Attach -> choose Other ec2 instances -> attach


e) Refresh
	//Check instances instance #1 -> NEtwork Interfaces

	a) Default 	-  public IPv4 - Private IPv4 - PPrivate IPv4 DNS

	//Check instances instance #2 -> NEtwork Interfaces

	a) Default 	-  public IPv4 - Private IPv4 - PPrivate IPv4 DNS
	
	b) DemoENI		-  			 Private IPv4(secondary) - PPrivate IPv4 DNS		//Demo ENI moved to other instance



----------We did failover between bw instances		//advanced ---------------------


f) Select both instances -> terminate --> Shutting down

//3 ENI
	2 default w EC2
	1 manually

//manually created ENI will stay
//other 2 will be deleted



----------What achieved by creating our own ENI? we have more control on our pvt IPv4s + more control over networking---------------

//helpful in advanced use cases
