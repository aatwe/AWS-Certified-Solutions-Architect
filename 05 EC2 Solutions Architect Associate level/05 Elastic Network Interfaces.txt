ENI(..)



1) what are ENI? logical component in VPC (virtual pvt clouds)
				a virtual network card


2) what is a network card?
	gives access to network


3) how ec2 instance access network? virtual network card
		//also used outside ec2 instance

4) AZ
	EC2-instance #1
	    eth0 - Primary (ENI) #1
			192.168.0.31		//provides instance with nw connectivity + pvt IP
			//pvt ipv4
 
	    eth1 - Secondary (ENI) #1
			192.168.0.42		//can add secondary ENI
			//pvt ipv4



	EC2-Instance #2
	    eth0 - Primary (ENI) #2
	

Each AZ can have 2 ENI(2 primary pvt IPv4)

Each ENI can have 1 elastic IPv4 per private IPv4
	ENI
		private IPv4
		  elastic IPv4
		public IPv4


5) >=1 security groups to an ENI

6) Mac address attached to ENI

7) Are ENI bounded to AZ? yes

8) Can we move ENI inside AZ and attach on fly?
	Yes can move eni independently, attach them on fly		

	Can move	 eth1 - Secondary (ENI) #1 from EC2-Instance #1 ----> to EC2-Instance #2
	//pvt ip will also move

looks like below:
		
		//When helpful?  can move ip around instances for failover purposes

   AZ
	EC2-instance #1
	    eth0 - Primary (ENI) #1
			192.168.0.31		//provides instance with nw connectivity + pvt IP
			//pvt ipv4
 



	EC2-Instance #2
	    eth0 - Primary (ENI) #3


	    eth1 - Secondary (ENI) #1
			192.168.0.42		//can add secondary ENI
			//pvt ipv4
