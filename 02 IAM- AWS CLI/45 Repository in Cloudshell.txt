We have full repository in cloud shell
i.e a place where things can be stored

ls
 
echo "test" > demo.txt
//what does this do?

Creates text file demo.txt with the word "test"


Does it get stored?
Try restarting the cloud shell
How to restart cloud shell -> right side -> actions -> Restart AWS Cloud Shell

-> ls 
demo.txt still there

Can configure Cloud shell from settings icon
