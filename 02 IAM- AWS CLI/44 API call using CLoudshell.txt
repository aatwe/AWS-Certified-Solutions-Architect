when you type commandd
aws iam list-users

This returns for you an API call as if the credentials being used were the credentials of the account we are using in cloud
right now
Hence API calls are working

~ aws iam list-users


//will list all the users in my accounts
//in this format

{
   "Users" : [
         {
             "Path": "/",
             "Username" : "stephane",
             "UserId" : "..."
             Arn
             CreateDate 
             PasswordLastUsed
	} 
]
}

CAN ALSO DO THE API CALL for any kind of region
just use --region argument

~ aws iam list-users --region

//Default region = region we currently logged in in Cloudshell
