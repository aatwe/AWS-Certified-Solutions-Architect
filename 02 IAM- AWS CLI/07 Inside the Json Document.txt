Json Document / IAM Policy


In plain englishDescribes what user/group of users are allowed to do?


For ex

"Verison" : "2012-10-17",
"Statement" :[
    {
         "Effect" : "Allow",
         "Action": "ec2:Describe"   // we allow users to use ec2 service and describe on it
         "Resource" : "*"

    },
    {
         "Effect" : "Allow",
         "Action": "Elasticloadbalancing:Describe"  //we allow users to use eelasticloadbalancing service and describe on it
         "Resource" : "*"
    },
   { 
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
		"cloudWatch:ListMetrics",     //allow users to use cloud watch
		"cloudWatch:GetMetricStatistics",
		"cloudWatch:Describe",
],
	"Resource" : "*"

   }
 ] 
}




We will see what ec2 service, elastic loadbalancing , cloud watch are later
Via this json document we are allowing users to use some services in AWS
These policy help us define permissions of our users.
We cant lalow everyone to do everything


Hence we apply least privelage principle 
Dont give more permissions than the user needs
